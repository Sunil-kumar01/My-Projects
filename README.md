This contains all Almabetter capstone projects at one place.
Terrorist attacks for domestic and international incidents data from the Global Terrorism Database from 1970-2017 includes more than 180000 attacks. This database is maintained by researchers of at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. I have uploaded this dataset to my python IDE.
During when I have imported some common libraries important for the analysis including numpy , pandas, seaborn,matplotlib along with folium and os.
Then I started analyzing and exploring the data using some of the python functions like df.head(), df.tail(),df.describe(), summary(), dtypes, Type(), corr(), index, Map,sum() isnull() etc.
I have found some null values which required the suitable treatment. After this I have checked the amount of available columns which were present in my dataset and I checked the correlation for these.
I saw that many columns were not relevant and more sensible for analysis so I have removed those columns. Apart from this there were columns which required renaming them and converted to suitable format.
 Once I dropped the unusual columns I started renaming them. Once I have done this I was ready to find out the Questions like most numbers of attacks by Region, country, city, and attack type group, territory and active gang involved in attack, what were used by most of the attacking groups etc.
 Used graphs or visualization according to my analysis, for example finding the region I have used by putting coordinates inside the Map function by folium and for comparing two variables I have used bar plot and likewise.
Al- Qaeda terrorist group involved in 2001( 8190) were wounded and (1340) killed and it was in Hijacking of Airlines.
Al-Qaeda groups have done most killings. Weapons used are explosives and vehicle-borne explosives. In 2001 there were more than 1 attack by Al- Qaeda.
Country with most attacks: Iraq, City with most attacks: Baghdad, Region with the most attacks: Middle East & North Africa and Year with the most attacks: 2014,Group with the most attacks: Taliban and Most Attack Types: Bombing/Explosion. Basra, Mosul, Kirkuk, Baghdad were the most attacked countries.
The number of kills increased rapidly after 2010 and where 2014 being the most deadly year having maximum number of killings.
From the visualization I also made few points that most active gangs are Taliban,CPI-Maoist,ISIL and also these are the groups more contagious. Where 47% of the terrorist groups are unknown.
